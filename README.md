# DDR_controller

We have designed a simple DDR controller which would be giving the control signals.And there would be also sending, and recieving data from the memory.

We have created the controller module with some arbitary and some ddr3 delay values for how much time should each stage take, we can reconfingure the delay in terms of cycles of each stage in the code.
